Windows Hello, the local platform authenticator in Windows 10 and 11, has the following capabilities:
creating and using single-device passkeys that are bound to the local device creating and using single-device passkeys on a FIDO2 security key The following is also possible in both Windows 10 and 11:</description></item><item><title>Terms</title><link>https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 13:26:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/</guid><description>2FA user #
A user whose account has 2FA turned on, i.e., who must present 2 authentication factors during sign-in.
2-Factor Authentication (2FA) #
also sometimes referred to as MFA: multi-factor authentication or 2SV: two-step verification
This refers to a contract between a user and a Relying Party (RP) where the RP must collect at least two distinct authentication factors from the user during a bootstrap sign-in.
Account bootstrapping #
A Relying Party (RP) authenticates a user without any prior knowledge of who the user is.</description></item><item><title>Specifications</title><link>https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/specs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 17:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/specs/</guid><description>The two primary technical specifications that work together to enable passkeys are Web Authentication, commonly referred to as WebAuthn, and the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), commonly referred to as FIDO2.
The two specs together are often referred to as one stack, FIDO2/WebAuthn.
W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) #
WebAuthn is the primary specification used by developers.
Platforms also create their own platform-specific abstractions of the WebAuthn API for use by native apps.</description></item></channel></rss>
